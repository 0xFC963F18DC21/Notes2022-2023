# 3rd year
- Scientia is a beta replacement for CATe. If it breaks, go back to CATe (and maybe get off your ass and find the issue to make a PR).
- You can find the NSS at https://www.thesutdentsurvey.com/.
	- Probably do this mid-term 2.
- Reduced coursework load?
- Exams, by default, are handwritten. Ask the examiners if you need some kind of different entry method.
- Modules are 4h/wk.
- Avoid timetable clashes.
- Term 3 is free for the individual project.
- Sign up for level 2 to indicate interest, 3 for credit registration **(Please remember to change from Lv2 to Lv3 when you want to commit to the module!)**.
