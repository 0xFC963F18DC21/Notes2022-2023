So... how do we type recursive definitions? Let's introduce another extension to lambda calculus, to turn it into a simple applicative language.

# $\Lambda^{NR}$

This extension allows us to focus on polymorphism and *recursion*, by introducing names for $\lambda$-terms and allowing names to *occur in all terms, as well as in definitions*.

$$\begin{align*}
    \text{name} &::= \text{'string of characters'} \\
    M, N &::= x\ |\ \text{name}\ |\ \lambda x.M\ |\ MN \\
    \text{Defs} &::= \text{Defs}; (\text{name} = M)\ |\ \text{Defs}; (\mathtt{rec}\ \text{name} = M)\ |\ \epsilon \hspace{1em} (M\ \text{is closed}) \\
    \text{Program} &::= \text{Defs} : M
\end{align*}$$

Reduction on $\Lambda^{NR}$ terms is defined as before for $\Lambda^N$.

By allowing names to appear within the body of definitions, we not only create a *dependency between definitions*, but also *the possibility of **recursive** definitions*.

Example:

$$\begin{alignat*}{3}
&S &&= \lambda x y z . xz(yz) &&&; \\
&K &&= \lambda x y . x &&&; \\
&I &&= SKK &&&; \\
&\mathtt{rec}\ Y &&= \lambda m.m(Ym) &&&:\\
&YI
\end{alignat*}$$

Programs written in $\Lambda^{NR}$ can easily be translated into $\lambda$-terms; for all non-recursive programs the translation consists of replacing, starting with the final term, all names by their bodies.

In the case of a recursive definition, we will have to use a fixed-point constructor. For most cases, we can use $Y = \lambda f . (\lambda x . f (x x)) (\lambda x . f (x x))$.

We also know that $Y M =_\beta M (Y M)$.

Now, if $M = \lambda x . N$, this becomes $Y (\lambda x . N) =_\beta (\lambda x . N)(Y (\lambda x / N)) \to_\beta N [Y (\lambda x . N) / x]$.

That gives us an equation like $F = N [F / x]$, with solution $F = Y (\lambda x . N)$.

So, in general, when we have an equation like $F = C[F]$, where $C[\ ]$ is a term with a hole (so $C[F]$ is a notation for a term in which $F$ occurs), then we can write:
$$F = C[F] = (\lambda f . C[F]) F = Y (\lambda f . C[F])$$
It's pretty good for implementation in reductions... but how do we type anything involving $Y$, like the factorial function (since $Y$ is untypeable in $\Lambda^{NR}$ at this point)?

Let's replace $Y$ with a black box (that does the exact same thing invisibly), and give that black box a type instead.

First, let's extend our language $\Lambda$ with a constant term...
$$M, N ::= x\ |\ \text{name}\ |\ \lambda x.M\ |\ MN\ |\ \mathbf{Y}$$
.. .a reduction rule...
$$\mathbf{Y} M \to M (\mathbf{Y} M)$$
... and add a type assignment rule.
$$\dfrac{}{\Gamma \vdash \mathbf{Y} : (A \to A) \to A}$$
Let's go through that reduction rule.

```
(A -> A) -> A 
(A -> B) -> B
|
| /--- A -> B
| |    |    |
| |    | A  |
| |    | ---+-
Y M -> M (Y M)
---    ---+---
 B        |  B
          (A -> B) -> B  
```

Well, we can fix this $A$, $B$ issue with $\mathbf{Y}$ at the unevaluated expression by just making $A = B$. Hence we have $\mathbf{Y} : (A \to A) \to A$.

This however, does have some issues. If we feed $\mathbf{Y}$ with the identity function, we get something non-terminating... with a polymorphic type.
$$\mathbf{Y} (\lambda x . x) : A$$
Now let us enhance our type assignment algorithm to fit $\Lambda^{NR}$. Note that we still cannot do mutual recursion, only self-recursion.

Recursive calls must have the same type as their recursive definition. We cannot allow polymorphic recursion. Hence why there is no allowed substitution on recursive calls compared to standard calls.

Implementations such as Haskell's type system subvert the non-polymorphic recursion restriction by extending this type assignment system. It is very much a *massive* extension to this.

Note that it is possible to encode mutual recursion by "[trampolining](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/trampoline)" the function calls in some way (tuples, [lists](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5272086), [etc](https://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/fixed-point-combinators.html).).
