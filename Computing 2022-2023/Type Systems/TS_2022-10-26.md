Give, with derivations, the principle types for the terms $\lambda x y z . x z (y z)$, $\lambda x y . x$, $\lambda x y . x y$ and $\lambda x . x$ in Curry's system.
$$\begin{align*}
    PPc\ \lambda x . x &= \left< \Pi, P \right>\ \text{where} \\
    x \in (x) \implies \left< \Pi', P' \right> &= PPc\ x = \left< x : A, A \right> \\
    x \in (x) \implies \Pi &= \Pi'\\
    \\
    \text{finally,}\ \left< \Pi, P \right> &= \left< \Pi', A \to A \right> 
\end{align*}$$
==Not as above, see **below**.==

```
              7
          ---------
           3    6
          --- -----
λ x y z . x z (y z)
          | |  | |
          1 2  4 5

4 |-> 5 -> 6
3 |-> 6 -> 7
2 |-> 5

Therefore:

(1 |-> 2 -> 3) |-> 2 -> 6 -> 7

x : 5 |-> 6 |-> 7
y : 5 |-> 6
z : 5

Finally:

(5 -> 6 -> 7) -> (5 -> 6) -> 5 -> 7
(A -> B -> C) -> (A -> B) -> A -> C
```

```
λ x y . x

      x : 1
λ y . x : 2 -> 1

=> 1 -> 2 -> 1 => A -> B -> A
```

```
         3
        ---
λ x y . x y
        | |
        1 2

1 |-> 2 -> 3

=> (2 -> 3) -> 2 -> 3 => (A -> B) -> A -> B
```

```
λ x . x

x : 1

=> 1 -> 1 => A -> A
```

This is sufficient to give a principal type without justification.

For the second part of the question:

```
PPc(λ x y z . x z (y z)) = (5 -> 6 -> 7) -> (5 -> 6) -> 5 -> 7
          PPc(λ x y . x) = 1 -> 2 -> 1
            PPc(λ x . x) = 1 -> 1
```

We haven't made this safe for unification yet. The 2nd and 3rd term share variables, so we need to rename them.

```
PPc(λ x y z . x z (y z)) = < {}, (5 -> 6 -> 7) -> (5 -> 6) -> 5 -> 7 > = P1
          PPc(λ x y . x) = < {}, 1 -> 2 -> 1 > = P2
            PPc(λ x . x) = < {}, 4 -> 4 > = P3
```

All of the contexts are empty in this case.

```
1st call to unify: unify P1 (P2 -> 8)
                     = (5 -> 6 -> 7) -> (5 -> 6) -> 5 -> 7     (1 -> 2 -> 1) -> 8
                   unify (5 -> 6 -> 7) (1 -> 2 -> 1)
                     = 5 |-> 1, 6 |-> 2, 7 |-> 1
                   unify (1 -> 2) -> 1 -> 1     8
                     = 8 |-> (1 -> 2) -> 1 -> 1

Therefore PPc(1st 2nd) = < {}, (1 -> 2) -> 1 -> 1 >
```

```
PPc(1st 2nd 3rd) would then be:

unify (1 -> 2) -> 1 -> 1     (4 -> 4) -> 9:
unify (1 -> 2) (4 -> 4)
  = 1 |-> 4, 2 |-> 4
unify (4 -> 4) 9
  = 9 |-> 4 -> 4
```

For that second example:

```
PPc((λ x y . x y) (λ x . x)):

unify (2 -> 3) -> 2 -> 3
      (1 -> 1) -> 4
  = 4 |-> 1 -> 1
```

Notice that their principal types are equal.
