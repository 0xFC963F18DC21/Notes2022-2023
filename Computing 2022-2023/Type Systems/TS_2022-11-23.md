If you can have $B = C[B]$ as a type in your language, that means it is a solution to $\mu X . C[X]$, and you can talk about $\text{fold}_B$ and $\text{unfold}_B$ for that type.

This can become important in the implementation as term information can be encoded in those folds and unfolds.

# Intersection Type Assignment

Intersection types are a way to allow more than one type for a variable (i.e. said variable has multiple simultaneous unprojectable types). It is a relatively light extension, but with a lot of implications.

Let's add a type connector, $\cap$.

Our type language now becomes:
$$A, B ::= \varphi\ |\ A \to B\ |\ A \cap B\ (\cap \text{ binds stronger than} \to)$$
... this does however, add some extra complexities like the transformation:
$$(A \to B) \cap (A \to C) \sim A \to (B \cap C)$$
Let's try a different syntax which is a bit more complex, but makes other things less annoying:
$$\begin{align*}
    (\text{Strict})\ A, B &::= \varphi\ |\ \sigma \to B\ \\
    (\text{Intersection})\ \sigma, \tau &::= A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_n\ (n \geq 1)\ |\ \top\ (\text{A } 0 \text{ type intersection, i.e. the Universal Type})
\end{align*}$$
Note that every other type is a subtype of $\top$, so it is a way of signifying that you aren't interested in that type. Our type assignment rules change as follows:
$$(A x): \dfrac{}{\Gamma, x : \cap_n A_i \vdash A_j}\ (1 \leq j \leq n)$$
$$(\to I): \dfrac{\Gamma, x : \sigma \vdash M : B}{\Gamma \vdash \lambda x . M : \sigma \to B}$$
$$(\to E): \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash M : \sigma \to A \hspace{2em} \Gamma \vdash N : \sigma}{\Gamma \vdash M N : A}$$
$$(\cap I): \dfrac{\Gamma \vdash M : A_1 \cdots \vdash M : A_n}{\Gamma \vdash M : A_1 \cap \dots \cap A_n}\ (n \geq 0)$$
Again, we can type self-application with it:
$$\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
        \dfrac{}{\Gamma \vdash x : A \to B}\ (A x)
        \hspace{2em}
        \dfrac{}{\Gamma \vdash x : A}\ (A x)
    }{
        \Gamma = x : (A \to B) \cap A \vdash xx : B
    }\ (\cap I)
}{
    \vdash \lambda x . x x : ((A \to B) \cap A) \to B
}\ (\to E)$$
Another, uninteresting way to type self-application is:
$$\dfrac{}{\vdash \lambda x . x x : \top}\ (A x)$$
Which may sometimes comes in handy.

So what if we want to type $(\lambda x y z . x z (y z)) (\lambda a b . a)$, in Curry's system we'll get $(B \to A) \to B \to B$. With intersection types, let's make the $yz$ in the first abstraction body have a type $\top$. Now:
- The outside $z : A$.
- The outside $x : (A \to \top \to A) \to \top \to A \to A$.
- The second abstraction has type $A \to \top \to A$.
Therefore our overall type is $\top \to A \to A$... and we can substitute the $\top$ on the final result (and the $\top$ on the outside of the brackets on the type of the outside $x$) with whatever.

**Note**: we can show that type assignment is closed under beta-equality, and that's what makes it undecidable:
$$\dfrac{\Gamma \vdash M : A \hspace{2em} M =_\beta N}{\Gamma \vdash N : A}$$
This rule does have a very convoluted proof involving the subject reduction theorem, the substitution lemma, and a lot of sub-proofs.

With intersection types... let's try typing self-application applied to itself:
$$(\lambda x . x x)(\lambda x . x x)$$
- $\text{unify } ((1 \to 2) \cap 1 \to 2)\ (((3 \to 4) \cap 3 \to 4) \to 5)$.
- $\text{unify } ((1 \to 2) \cap 1)\ ((3 \to 4) \cap 3 \to 4)$.
    - The $\cap 3$ can be split into:
        - $(5 \to 6) \cap 5 \to 6$.
        - $(7 \to 8) \cap 7 \to 8$.
    - And these can be intersected together to form the final right hand side type of:
        - $((5 \to 6) \cap 5 \to 6) \cap ((7 \to 8) \cap 7 \to 8)$.
- $\text{unify } 1 ((7 \to 8) \cap 7 \to 8)$... is trivial.
- $\text{unify } (((7 \to 8) \cap 7 \to 8) \to 2)\ ((5 \to 6) \cap 5 \to 6)$.

Oops, it has looped (we're unifying the same structures as our first step, since unification is commutative). Typing intersection types may fail or loop indefinitely... and that's despite the fact that intersection types are finite.

To say something is typeable in this system is to ask for a type for a term that is ***not*** $\top$... since $\top$ is a trivial supertype of everything. Usually this means that the term has a HNF:
$$\Gamma \vdash M : A\ (A \neq \top) \iff M\ \text{has a HNF}$$
And if a term always normalises (strongly normalises):
$$\Gamma \vdash M : A\ (\top \not \in \Gamma, A) \iff M\ \text{is Strongly Normalisable}$$
You can also prove that "computability $\iff$ reducibility". It isn't difficult but it takes quite a strange and unexpected route.

## Approximants

Well, we can now use approximants to say:
$$\Gamma \vdash M : B \iff \exists A \in \mathcal{A}(M) [\Gamma \vdash A : B]$$
As in, if and only if there is some term $M$ is typeable without $\top$, then there is some approximant $A$ where $A$ has the same type as $M$.

We now have an extra rule where:
$$\Gamma \vdash \bot : \top$$
So if we have some approximant $A$ for $M$ where $M \to^* N$ and $A \sqsubseteq N$, if we have:
$$\dfrac{
    \dfrac{\bot : \top}{\vdots}
}{
    \Gamma \vdash A : B
}$$
Then we have:
$$\dfrac{
    \dfrac{Q : \top}{\vdots}
}{
    \Gamma \vdash N : B
}$$
- $A \sqsubseteq M \implies ???$
- $\Gamma \vdash A : B \implies ???$
- $\Gamma \vdash M : B \implies ???$
$$\begin{align*}
    pp\ A : pp\ xA_1 \dots A_n &= \left< \Pi, \varphi \right> \\
    pp\ A_i &= \left< \Pi_i; P_i \right> \\
    \Pi &= \Pi_1 \cap \dots \cap \Pi_n \cap \{ x : P_1 \to \dots \to P_n \to \varphi \} \\
    \\
    pp\ (\lambda x . A \cdots) &= \text{Practically the same as above.}
\end{align*}$$
and we also have $pp\ A = \left< \Pi, P \right> \implies \Pi \vdash A : P$.

Another rule is that if $\Gamma \vdash A : B$ then there exists an operation on types $O$ such that $pp\ A = \left< \Pi, P \right>$ and $O\left< \Pi, P \right> = \left< \Gamma, B \right>$. The proof is very, very lengthy.

If $A_1, A_2 \in \mathcal{A}(M)$ then there exists $A_3 \in \mathcal{A}(M)$ such that $A_1 \sqsubseteq A_3$ and $A_2 \sqsubseteq A_3$. This means that $A_1$ and $A_2$ contains more $\bot$ than $A_3$, so any types given to $A_1$ or $A_2$ can be given to $A_3$.

This means that if $\mathcal{A}(M)$ is finite, $\mathcal{A}(M)$ has a maximal element, and since principal type assignment propagates upwards, the principal type of the largest approximant in $\mathcal{A}(M)$ is the principal type of the term $M$:
$$pp\ M = pp\ A_\text{max}\ \text{where}\ A_\text{max} = \text{max}\ \mathcal{A}(M)$$
This also means that if the approximant set is infinite, then in this system, a term has *an infinitely large principal type*, $pp\ M = \{ pp\ A\ |\ A \in \mathcal{A}(M) \}$.

Going back to $\lambda f . (\lambda x . f (x x)) (\lambda x . f (x x))$, we know that its approximant set is $\{ \bot, \lambda f . f \bot, \lambda f . f (f \bot), \cdots \}$. This means that the principal type for the fixpoint combinator is infinite... hence it has this intersection type:
$$(\top \to \varphi_1) \cap \dots \cap (\varphi_n \to \varphi_{n + 1}) \to \varphi_{n + 1}$$
Which means you can also argue that the fixpoint combinator doesn't have a principal type.
