# Total Store Ordering

In a weak memory model (WMM), instructions of a thread may be reordered, and execute out of order.
This means that one may observe some weak behaviours (anomalies) that are not observable under SC.

E.g. the C11 memory model (used by C++ and C past their 2011 standards) uses a weak memory model for optimisation purposes.

We will study the Intel-x86 Architecture, which uses a weak memory model called **T**otal **S**tore **O**rdering.

This allows **write-read reordering** on different locations, where a later read on `y` can be reordered before an earlier write on `x` when `x != y`.

No other re-ordering is allowed. Essentially, TSO is SC plus write-read reordering. This allows the weak store buffering behaviour.

So what are its operational semantics?

Well, its model is pretty similar to SC, with an addition of a thread-local store buffer per thread:

![[TSO.png]]

(Note: `unbuffer` runs at non-deterministic times. There are heuristics that tell threads when to do so, but it is still non-deterministic.)

These buffers exist to minimise the latency for reading data, as writing to RAM is much slower than writing to a small buffer that may be stored in the CPU's cache. It aids in increasing the performance of things like speculative execution.

In essence, this is splitting a write operation into two parts:
1. Issuing the command to write to memory.
2. Actually writing the data into memory.

Note that it **is** possible to stop this reordering using memory fences (barriers against reordering, which may reduce performance. These are expensive instructions that tell the CPU to ensure their store buffer is empty before proceeding past it.

Let's update the model to include those fences:

![[Fence.png]]

(`unbuffer` is still executes at non-deterministic times.)

RMW operations also stop this re-ordering from happening, as these also can act as barriers (which may also reduce performance).

Let's also update that to include those RMW instructions:

# Fenced ConWhile

Let's extend ConWhile with fences to help us model TSO!

$$\begin{align*}
    B \in Bool &::= \text{true}|\text{false}|\dots \\
    E \in Exp &::= \dots|E + E|\dots \\
    C \in Com &::= a := E\ |\ a := x\ |\ x := a\ |\ a := \mathtt{CAS}(x, E, E)\ |\ \mathtt{FAA}(x, E)\ |\ \mathtt{skip}\ |\ \mathtt{mfence}\ |\ C;C\ |\ \mathtt{while}\ B\ \mathtt{do} C\ |\ \mathtt{if}\ B\ \mathtt{then}\ C\ \mathtt{else}\ C
\end{align*}$$

Program and boolean expressions stay the same.
Programs are modelled the same.

Shared memory, store maps and stores as before.

Remember that each thread has a private buffer for delating writes. This means that each thread is now associated with a buffer, modelled as a FIFO sequence of delayed write labels:
$$b \in Buff \triangleq Seq\left< WLab \right>$$
where $WLab \triangleq \{ (\mathtt{W}, x, v)\ |\ x \in Loc \land v \in Val \}$.

We then define a buffer map associating each thread with each private buffer:
$$B \in BMap \triangleq Tid \to Buff$$
where $b = B(\tau)$ denotes the buffer of thread $\tau$.

Therefore, a TSO configuration is a quadruple, $(P, S, M, B)$, instead of a triple like SC's.

# TSO Op-Sem

The program transitions are the same as SC, except they have an additional transition for $\mathtt{mfence}$.
The storage transitions are different as they have to take buffers into account.

We denote $\mathtt{mfence}$'s transition label as $\mathtt{MF}$.

The program transition for $\mathtt{mfence}$ is as follows:
$$\frac{}{\mathtt{mfence}, s \xrightarrow{\mathtt{MF}}_c \mathtt{skip, s}}$$

TSO storage transitions are of the form $M, B \xrightarrow{\tau : l}_m M', B'$. As before, $\tau$ is arbitrary, but we can only unify storage and program transitions if their steps and labels match.

RMWs, however, act as barriers and ensure that there are no delayed writes in the buffer.

Finally, we can develop the semantics in the following form:

If the program takes a silent step, the storage system remains unchanged.
$$\frac{P, S \xrightarrow{\tau : \epsilon}_p P', S'}{P, S, M, B \to P', S', M, B}$$
Similarly, if the storage system takes a silent step, then the program and store maps remain unchanged.
$$\frac{M, B \xrightarrow{\tau : \epsilon}_m M', B'}{P, S, M, B \to P, S, M', B'}$$
Finally, if both the program and storage systems take the ***same transition***, then we can combine them into a transition over a TSO configuration.
$$\frac{P, S \xrightarrow{\tau : l}_p P', S' \hspace{2em} M, B \xrightarrow{\tau : l}_m M', B'}{P, S, M, B \to P', S', M', B'}$$

As before, we write $\to^{*}$ for the reflexive, transitive closure of $\to$. Formally:

And finally, TSO is neither deterministic nor confluent.

Questions:

Assume $P$ is:
$$a := \mathtt{CAS}(x, 0, 1)$$
The first step of the SC Op-Sem of $P$ is (assuming the CAS is successful):
$$\dfrac{
    \dfrac{
        \mathtt{eval}(\{ a \mapsto 0 \}, 0) = 0
        \hspace{2em}
        \mathtt{eval}(\{ a \mapsto 0 \}, 1) = 1
        \hspace{2em}
        s' = \{ a \mapsto 0 \}[a \mapsto 1]
    }{
        a := \mathtt{CAS}(x, 0, 1), \{ a \mapsto 0\}
        \xrightarrow{\tau_1 : (\mathtt{U}, x, 0, 1)}_c
        \mathtt{skip}, s'
    }
