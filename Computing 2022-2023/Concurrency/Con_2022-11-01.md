# Declarative Semantics

Declarative (a.k.a. axiomatic) semantics are an alternative way of defining the semantics of something.
- They define the notion of program execution (i.e. generalisation of an execution trace).
- They map a program to a set of *candidate* executions.
- They define a *consistency* predicate on executions.
- They define semantics as a set of *consistent* executions of a program.

An exception are "catch-fire" semantics, where there is existence of at least one "bad" consistent execution which implies undefined behaviour.

We can model these semantics as graphs:

Let's have an example as a program with store buffering:

![[ExGExm.png]]

These arrows represent *events* (... memory instructions).

**Events** are triples $\left< n, \tau, l \right>$ where:
- $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is a unique event identifier.
- $\tau \in \text{Tid} \cup \{ 0 \}$ is a thread identifier.
- $l$ is a non-empty ($\neq \epsilon$) label.

A non-empty label is simply a (model-specific) label that is not representing a silent transition (that would have been represented by an $\epsilon$).

In diagrams, we will show:
- events by their label only, and forgo the event and thread identifiers.
- initialisation events at the top of the diagram (usually denoted with the $\text{Tid}$ 0).

Side note about mathematical ordering:
- All orders are transitive. $\forall a, b, c. (a, b) \in R \land (b, c) \in R \implies (a, c) \in R$.
- Strict orders are irreflexive. $\neg \exists a. (a, a) \in R$.
- Total orders are antisymmetric. $\forall a, b. a \neq b \implies (a, b) \in R \oplus (b, a) \in R$ (conversely, $\forall a, b . (a, b) \in R \land (b, a) \in R \implies a = b$).

## Labels and Events

- For some label $l$, we write $\mathtt{typ}(l)$ for the type of $l$.
    - $\mathtt{typ}((\mathtt{R}, x, v_r)) \triangleq \mathtt{R}$.
    - $\mathtt{typ}((\mathtt{W}, x, v_w)) \triangleq \mathtt{W}$.
    - $\mathtt{typ}((\mathtt{U}, x, v_r, v_w)) \triangleq \mathtt{U}$.
- For some label $l$, we write $\mathtt{loc}(l)$ for the location accesses.
- For some label $l$, $\mathtt{val_r}(l)$ for the value read, and $\mathtt{val_w}(l)$ for the value written.
- For an event $e$, we write $\mathtt{tid}(e)$ for its thread identifier, and $\mathtt{lab}(e)$ for its label.
- We lift the $\mathtt{typ}$, $\mathtt{loc}$, $\mathtt{val_r}$, $\mathtt{val_w}$ to also work on events, where if called on an event, can be thought of as the composition $\circ\ \mathtt{lab}$.

## Relational Notation

## Executions

An execution graph is a tuple $\left< E, po, rf \right>$ where:
- $E$ is a finite set of events.
- $po$ is the "program order" such that:
    - $po \triangleq (\bigcup\limits_{\tau \in \text{Tid}}\ po_\tau) \cup (E_0 \times (E \setminus E_0))$
    - each $po_\tau$ is a strict total order on $E_\tau$.
- $rf$ s the "reads-from" binary relation on $E$ such that:
    - $\forall \left< w, r \right> \in rf$:
        - $w \neq r$.
        - $\mathtt{typ}(w) \in \{ \mathtt{W}, \mathtt{U} \} \land \mathtt{typ}(r) \in \{ \mathtt{R}, \mathtt{U} \}$.
        - $\mathtt{loc}(w) = \mathtt{loc}(r)$.
        - $\mathtt{val_w}(w) = \mathtt{val_r}(r)$.
    - $rf^{-1}$ is a function.
    - If $\left< w_1, r \right>, \left< w_2, r \right> \in rf$ then $w_1 = w_2$.

## Declarative Semantics for SC and TSO

### SC

- Definition
    - Let $\mathtt{sc}$ be a strict total order on $G.\mathtt{E}$. $G$ is called **SC-*consistent*** with respect to $\mathtt{sc}$ if the following hold:
        - If $\left< a, b \right> \in G.\mathtt{po}$ then $\left< a, b \right> \in \mathtt{sc}$. I.e. $G.\mathtt{po} \subseteq \mathtt{sc}$.
        - If $\left< w, r \right> \in G.\mathtt{rf}$ then $\left< w, r \right> \in \mathtt{sc}$. I.e. $G.\mathtt{rf} \subseteq \mathtt{sc}$.
        - If $\left< w, r \right> \in G.\mathtt{rf}$ then $\neg \exists w'. w \in G.\mathtt{W}_{\mathtt{loc}(r)} \implies \left< w, w' \right> \in \mathtt{sc} \land \left< w', r \right> \in \mathtt{sc}$.
    - An execution graph $G$ is called SC-consistent if the following hold:
        - $G$ is complete.
        - $G$ is SC-consistent with respect to some strict total order $\mathtt{sc}$ on $G.\mathtt{E}$.

Example:

![[SBEx.png]]

An alternative representation of sequential consistency is looking at modification order:
- $\mathtt{mo}$ is called a modification order for an execution graph $G$ if $\mathtt{mo} = \bigcup\limits_{x \in \text{Loc}}\ \mathtt{mo}_x$ where each $\mathtt{mo}_x$ is a strict total order on $G.\mathtt{WU}_x$.
- An execution graph $G$ is called SC-consistent if the following hold:
    - $G$ is complete.
    - There exists a modification order $\mathtt{mo}$ for $G$ such that $\text{acyclic}(G.\mathtt{po} \cup G.\mathtt{rf} \cup \mathtt{mo} \cup \mathtt{rb})$ holds, where $\mathtt{rb} \triangleq G.\mathtt{rf}^{-1};\ \mathtt{mo} \setminus \text{id}$ (from-reads / reads-before).
