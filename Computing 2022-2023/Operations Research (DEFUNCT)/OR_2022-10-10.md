# Intro

![[OR Books.png]]

Operations research is a branch of maths involving mathematical modelling, mathematical optimisation, and statistical analysis in order to find good solutions for problems.

Typically, we want to maximise profit and efficiency while minimising cost, risk and completion time, etc., etc..

We are solving **optimisation problems**, given some *cost* functions (to minimise) and *objective* functions (to maximise).

Sometimes, we have to find the problem first before we can optimise solutions for it.

It may look a little like what ML is doing, but ML is essentially applied OR.

# Mathematical Programming

OR solves mathematical models. We want to minimise `z = f(x)`, subject to `x ∈ X`, where `x` is our decision variables, `f` is our objective function, `X` is the feasible set (set of allowed decisions).

Any vector `x` that minimises `f` is an optimal solution of the program and is denoted by `x*`. `z* = f(x*)`  is the *optimal value* achieved by x.

(It is assumed that `x` is a vector, `f` is a function that takes vectors, and `X` is a subset of the cartesian product of the sets of possible inputs.)

# Scope

This is a very generalisable field, whose techniques can be applied anywhere: operations management, industrial engineering, economics and finance, ICT management, machine learning, healthcare, security, etc..

It even applies to just general optimisation of algorithms!

Strangely enough, problems with discrete feasible sets are (a lot of the time) harder than problems with continuous feasible sets.

# Phases of OR Study

1. Define the problem of interest and gather relevant data.
2. **Formulate a mathematical model to represent the problem.**
3. **Develop a computer-based procedure for deriving solutions to the problem from the model.**
4. Test the model and refine as needed.
5. Prepare for the ongoing application of the model as prescribed by management.
6. Implement the solution.

This course focuses on 2 and 3.

# Topics

- Linear Programming (with Simplex and friends)
- Duality (sort of like reduction of decision problems; with a coursework on Game Theory (... the mathematical field, not the crackpot youtube channel))
- Integer Programming (decision making with discrete choices, and not continuous choices)
- Optimisation Modelling
- GLPK Case Studies (extra and optional)

Coursework can be worked on in groups!

# Linear Programming

A linear program (LP) is a mathematical program that optimises a linear objective function over a feasible set described by linear equality (and / or inequality constraints).

This is an optimal decision tool that is widely adopted. We will cover linear optimisation only in this course.

Example 1:

```
  maximise    z = x1 + x2
subject to    x1 + 3x2 <= 3
              x1 = 3
              x1, x2 >= 0
```

Is this a linear program?

... yes, but it is a very trivial linear program: `x* = [3, 0]`, `z* = 3`.

Example 2:

```
  maximise    z = x1 + x2
subject to    (x1 + 3x2)² <= 3
              x1 = 3
              x1, x2 >= 0
```

Is this still a linear program?

... no, as one of the constraints is a quadratic inequality constraint.

(For the sake of completeness, it is impossible to optimise this program as the constraints clash against each other.)

... But, we can transform this into a linear program!

We know that the square root shows monotonicity, so we can rewrite that example into a linear program:

```
  maximise    z = x1 + x2
subject to    x1 + 3x2 <= sqrt(3)
              x1 = 3
              x1, x2 >= 0
```

... It's still undecideable, however.

Example 3:

```
  maximise    z = x1 + x2
subject to    x1 + x1x2 <= 3
              x1 = 3
              x1, x2 >= 0
```

Is *this* a linear program?

... no. Linear terms are defined as `cx_i` where `c` is some constant or fixed variable.

(`x*` and `z*` are the same as example 1's `x*` and `z*`.)

# LP Example

A manufacturer produces A (acid) and C (caustic soda) and wants to decide a production plan.

The raw ingredients that need to be bought are: X and Y (we don't care what they are at the moment).

- A's production ratio is 1A : 2X : 1Y.
- C's production ratio is 1C : 1X : 3Y.
- Supply of X is limited to 11 tons / week.
- Supply of Y is limited to 18 tons / week.
- Both A and C can be sold at £1000 / ton.
- Market research says that only 4 tons of A can be sold per week.

Maximise weekly value sales of A and C.

So:

```
  maximise    z = A + C
subject to    A = Xa/2 + Ya
              C = Xc + Yc/3
              0 <= Xa + Xc <= 11
              0 <= Ya + Yc <= 18
              0 <= A <= 4
              0 <= C
```

We need to maximise `z`, which is our weekly profit (as a multiplier of £1000).

A production plan `x`, is represented as `(A, C)`.

Trivially, we have a straight line that we want to move away from the origin towards the upper-right quadrant as possible.

From the LP above, we can say that `X = 2A + C` and `Y = A + 3C`. We also have `0 <= X <= 11` and `0 <= Y <= 18`.

![[PSet.png]]

And here is our polytope... a bounded polytope, formed from a set of linear constraints, joint together. The polytope represents our final feasible set from the constraints. There may also be bounded polytopes, which are also not as nice to work with.

This is a rather benign or tame example, as all vertices are formed from the intersection of two constraints. Some can have vertices formed of three or more (which are nasty).

Note that this problem allows continuous inputs, as we are working with liquids.

We can now look at the vertices of the polytope.

A better LP of the above is this:

```
  maximise    z = A + C
subject to    2A + C <= 11
              A + 3C <= 18
              A <= 4
              A, C >= 0
```

(Real-world problems would have far more variables and constraints, where you'd probably ask for a solution from a computer.)

![[GSol.png]]

Putting it all together, we can see that `z*` is 8 in this case, which makes `A = 3`, `C = 5` as that intersects vertex Q. So, `x* = [3, 5]`.

The fact that the solution is at a vertex is actually a general property of optimising these linear program, as there always exists a solution (not always the optimal solution) that is on a vertex, but sometimes you can get solutions not always in the vertex... if the program is feasible. There is also no unique solution.

We can assume the feasible set `X` is bounded and nonempty, and that LPs have an optimal vertex solution.

We could always solve them by inspecting all the vertices, but the number of those increases with the number of constraints and variables in the LP... exponentially.

Therefore, we need to program a computer to efficiently solve LPs. The Simplex Algorithm is one such algorithm that finds an optimal vertex. It usually only inspects a small subset of the total, and it works well on most instances (has an excellent average behaviour).

... and that is despite Simplex has a complexity of O(x^n).

## Variants

Another possible situation is that the feasible set becomes empty due to the constraints. This means the LP is infeasible.

An alternative wording is that an LP is infeasible if the constraints are incompatible with each other.

The last possible situation is that the constraints are not enough to give a finite upper bound on the objective function, so there is no maximum (as there is always something larger). This means the LP is unbounded.

An alternative wording is that an LP is unbounded if the cost function can approach negative infinity or if the objective function can approach positive infinity.
