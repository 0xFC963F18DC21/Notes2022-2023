# Linear Programs in Standard Form

LP is a tool for optimal decision making:

- *Min/max* a linear objective function.
- Using linear constraints (equalities / inequalities).
- The feasible region is a *convex polyhedron*.
- The vertices of the feasible region contain a solution to the LP problem *if it is well-defined*.
	- An LP can be solved by examining all vertices, but this approach is computationally prohibitive (exponential worst case per constraint)!

We will use the Simplex algorithm to track some of these vertices for the solution, and learn how to formulate an LP in a *standard way*.

We need a standardised specification of LP problems.

An LP is in *standard form* if:
- The aim is to **minimise** a linear objective function.
- All constraints are **linear equality constraints**.
- All constraint RHSes are **non-negative**.
- All decision variables are **non-negative**.

An LP in standard form looks like:

```
  minimise    z = c1x1  +  c2x2 +  ... +  cnxn
subject to        a11x1 + a12x2 +  ... + a1nxn = b1
                  a21x1 + a22x2 +  ... + a2nxn = b2
                               ...
                  am1x1 + am2x2 +  ... + amnxn = bm
```

We can collect the input parameters in vectors and matrices.

For example:

```
  minimise    z = x1 + 5x2 + 4x3
sunject to    x1 + 3x2 + x3 = 3
              x1 + x3 = 3
              x1, x2 >= 0
```

This is not in standard form. The constraint `x3 >= 0` is missing.

Another example:

```
  minimise     z = x1 - 5x2 + 4x3
subject to     x1 + 3x2 + x3 = -3
               x1 + x3 = 3
               x1, x2, x3 >= 0
```

This is not in standard form, as the RHS of the first constraint is negative.

# Standardising General LPs

General LP problems can:
- be maximisation instead of minimisation problems
- have inequality constraints
- have equiality constraints with negative RHSes
- have free (instead of non-negative) decision variables.

## Max `->` Min

Inverting the objective preserves the optimal solution `x*`.

```
 max    y = f(x) | - min    z = -f(x)
s.t.    x in X   |  s.t.    x in X
```

Optimal value of the objective is `y*` = `-z*`.

## `<=` Inequalities `->` Equalities

We need to introduce slack (artificial) variables to help with this.

We turn this into:

![[SlackVars.png]]

We need these slack variables to turn an inequality constraint into an equality constraint. This is allowed, as we are treating these slack variables the same as the decision variables.

![[SVars2.png]]

If our inequality is `>=` and not `<=`, use *excess* variables (same as a slack variable, but is subtracted from the constraints).

# Equivalence

- Assume initial problem is not in standard form.
- `x`: feasible solution to the initial problem.
- `(x, s)`: feasible solution to the standardised problem.
- `x` can be associated with one and only one `(x, s)` using the reformulations we have defined.
- In particular, optimal solutions will be `x*` and `(x*, s*)`, where `x*` is the same in both formulations.

# Negative RHSes

If the right hand side of the *i*th constraint is negative, then this constraint should be multiplied by `-1`. That is all.

# Free Variables

... What about `!=`?

We usually ignore this because it causes a lot of problems with our feasible set boundaries and shape (the feasible set always has to be connected, as it needs to be a convex polygon). `<` and `>` also complicate matters, so we don't concern ourselves with them.

# Standard Form of an LP

- Basic solutions
- Algebra vs. Geometry
- Fundamental theorem of linear programming
- Basic representation

We will assume that we will focus on Standard Form LPs:
- `#` of variables = n `>=` m = `#` of equations (otherwise, the system Ax = b is overdetermined)
- Rows of A is linearly independent (otherwise, the constrains are inconsistent or reduntant.)

Linear dependence of rows in A implies either:
- Contradictory constraints
- Redundant constraints

# Index Sets

Consider only the system of linear equations in problem `LP`: `Ax = b`:
- Let `A = [a1, ..., an]` where `ai` is the *i*th column vector of `A`.
- Select a subset of `m` columns `ai` that are linearly independent. This is always possible since `m = rank(A)` and `n >= m`.
- Collect in the index set `I` the indices for these `m` columns. `I` is therefore a subset of `{1 .. n}`.

**Definition**: The matrix `B = B(I) ∈ Rm×m` consisting of the columns `{ai}i ∈ I` is called the basis corresponding to the index set `I`.
